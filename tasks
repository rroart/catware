Task 2

The resulting diagram is simple, due to I have not worked with diagrams at work, the last time was during my education, when the modelling was not UML.

Using typical cloud services with autoscaling and cloud databases this
should handle millions of shortenings.

I also assume that this is a commercial provider like bit.ly.
(Which requires some more complexity, like eventual deletion and recording stats (including audits and bookkeeping).

The delivered diagram file is print.pdf.

Task 3

I assume that the sports retailer has a generic solution running on
some non-scalable architecture.
Continuing on that architecture is not a good option.
Buying new hardware may solve the problem temporarily, but not in the long run.
If lifting it (or both) out and migrating to an autoscaling cloud solution with
a scalable cloud database the problem would be solved.
